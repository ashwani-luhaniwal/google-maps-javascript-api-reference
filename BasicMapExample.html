                    JavaScript class that represents a map is the "Map" class. Objects of this class define
                    a single map on a page. (You may create more than one instance of this class - each 
                    object will define a separate map on the page). We create a new instance of this class
                    using JavaScript "new" operator. When you create a new map instance, you specify a
                    <div> HTML element in the page as a container for the map.
                    This code defines a variable (named map) and assigns that variable to a new Map object.
                    The function Map() is known as constructor and its defition as follows: 

                        Map(mapDiv:Node, opts?:MapOptions)
                    Creates new map inside of given HTML container - which is typically a div element - using
                    any (optional) parameters that are passed.

            Libraries: When loading Maps JavaScript API via the URL you may optionally load additional
            libraries through use of the "libraries" URL parameter. Libraries are modules of code that
            provide additional functionality to main Maps JavaScript API but are not loaded unless
            you specifically request them.

            Synchronously loading the API: In script tag that loads Maps JavaScript API, it is possible
            to omit "async" attribute and "callback" parameter. This will cause loading of API to block
            until API is downloaded. This will probably slow your page load. But it means you can write
            subsequent script tags assuming that the API is already loaded.

            The "async" attribute lets the browser render the rest of your website while Maps JavaScript 
            API loads. When the API is ready, it will call the function specified using the 
            "callback" parameter.
            The "key" parameter contains your application's API key.
